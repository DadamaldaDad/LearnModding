# Learn Modding
Made by following [Kaupenjoe's tutorials for Forge 1.20.X modding](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKGarocXCE1H9Y21-pxjt5Pt8bW14twa-) with my own spin on it.

Issues are basically a comment section and pull requests are not allowed, since this is my learning experience.

##  My thought process
I wanted to learn modding and to start, I thought I should actually follow the tutorials instead of just watching them.

My project has differences from the original and is NOT a fork. I want to change every item to something different, but somewhat similar and stick to some themes to improve at thinking. I also make the textures myself to hone my pixel art skills.

 ## Completeness
 I currently have 11 out of 44 episodes done.
